    <h2>Preventing adverse health effects due to heat</h2>

    <p>
      Rising sea levels. Raging storms. Searing heat. Ferocious fires. Severe
      drought. Punishing floods. The effects of climate change are already
      threatening our health, our communities, our economy, our security, and
      our childrenâ€™s future.

      <span><strong>What can you do?</strong></span
      >A whole lot, as it turns out. Americans, on average, produce 21 tons of
      carbon a year, about four times the global average. Personal action is, of
      course, no substitute for meaningful government policies. We still must
      limit carbon pollution and aggressively move away from dirty fossil fuels
      toward cleaner power.
